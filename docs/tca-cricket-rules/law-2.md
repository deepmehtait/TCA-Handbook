### Change of umpire

An umpire shall not be changed during the match, other than in exceptional circumstances unless he/she is injured or ill.  If there has to be a change of umpire, the replacement shall act only as of the striker’s end umpire unless the captains agree that the replacement should take full responsibility as an umpire.

- Act only as leg umpire (striker’s end umpire), if the umpire is affiliated to one of the two playing teams.
- Act in full responsibility, if the umpire is not affiliated to any one of the two playing teams. The affiliation of the replacement umpire shall be
ascertained by the Umpiring and Appeals Committee upon request from Captains or the remaining umpire.
- In Tennisball Cricket Association organized matches an umpire shall not be changed during the match, other than in exceptional circumstances unless he is injured or ill.

### Consultation with captains

Before the toss, the umpires shall

- meet with the captains; the umpires shall determine

  - the balls to be used during the match.  See Law 4 (The ball).

  - the hours of play and the times and durations of any agreed intervals.  In a match of one day’s duration, no specific time need be agreed for the tea interval.  It may be agreed instead to take this interval between innings.  See Law 11 (Intervals).

  - Which clock or watch and the backup timepiece is to be used during the match.

  - The boundary of the field of play and allowances for boundaries as per TCA laws, including whether any obstacle within the field of play is to be regarded as a boundary.  See Law 19 (Boundaries).

  - The use of covers. See Law 10 (Covering the pitch).

  - Any special conditions of play affecting the conduct of the match.

 - inform the scorers of agreements in above items.

### The wickets, creases, and boundaries

Before the toss and during the match, the umpires shall satisfy themselves that

- The wickets are properly pitched.  See Law 8 (The wickets)

- The creases are correctly marked.  See Law 7 (The creases).

- The boundary of the field of play complies with the requirements of Laws 19.1 (Determining the boundary of the field of play), 19.2 (Identifying and marking the boundary) and 19.3 (Restoring the boundary).

### Conduct of the match, implements, and equipment

Before the toss and during the match, the umpires shall satisfy themselves that

- The conduct of the match is strictly in accordance with the Laws.

- The implements used in the match conform to the following:

  - Law 4 (The ball).

  - externally visible requirements of Law 5 (The bat) and Appendix B.

  - 2.5.2.3 either Laws 8.2 (Size of stumps) and 8.3 (The bails) or, if applicable, Law 8.4 (Junior cricket).

- No player uses equipment other than that permitted.  See Appendix A.2.  Note particularly therein the interpretation of ‘protective helmet’.

- The wicket-keeper’s gloves comply with the requirements of Law 27.2 (Gloves).

### Fair and unfair play

The umpires shall be the sole judges of fair and unfair play.

### Fitness for play

- It is solely for the umpires together to decide whether either condition of the ground, weather or light or exceptional circumstances mean that it would be dangerous or unreasonable for play to take place.

Conditions shall not be regarded as either dangerous or unreasonable merely because they are not ideal.

The fact that the grass and the ball are wet does not warrant the ground conditions being regarded as unreasonable or dangerous.

- Conditions shall be regarded as dangerous if there is actual and foreseeable risk to the safety of any player or umpire.

- Conditions shall be regarded as unreasonable if, although posing no risk to safety, it would not be sensible for play to proceed.

- If the umpires consider the ground is so wet or slippery as to deprive the bowler of a reasonable foothold, the fielders of the power of free movement, or the batsmen of the ability to play their strokes or to run between the wickets, then these conditions shall be regarded as so bad that it would be dangerous and unreasonable for play to take place.

### Suspension of play in dangerous or unreasonable circumstances

- All references to ground include the pitch.  See Law 6.1 (Area of pitch).

- The Umpires shall immediately suspend play, or not allow play to start or to recommence if either umpire considers that the conditions of ground, weather or light, or any other circumstances are either dangerous or unreasonable.

- When there is a suspension of play it is the responsibility of the umpires to monitor conditions.  They shall make inspections as often as appropriate, unaccompanied by any players or officials.  Immediately the umpires together agree that the conditions are no longer dangerous or unreasonable they shall call upon the players to resume play.

2.9 Position of umpires

The umpires shall stand where they can best see any act upon which their decision may be required.

Subject to this over-riding consideration, the bowler’s end umpire shall stand in a position so as not to interfere with either the bowler’s run-up or the striker’s view.

The striker’s end umpire may elect to stand on the offside instead of the on side of the pitch, provided he/she informs the captain of the fielding side, the striker and the other umpire.

### Umpires changing ends

The umpires shall change ends once after every two overs.

In case of non-availability of one umpire, the second must assume responsibility of the leg-umpire. No rotation is permitted in this case.
In case of non-availability of both umpires captains of both teams must inform the appropriate authority to make necessary adjustments

### Disagreement and dispute

Where there is disagreement or dispute about any matter, the umpires together shall make the final decision.  See also Law 31.6 (Consultation by umpires).

### Umpire’s decision

An umpire may alter any decision provided that such alteration is made promptly. This apart, an umpire’s decision, once made, is final.

### Signals

-  The following code of signals shall be used by umpires:

- Signals made while the ball is in play

- Dead ball - by crossing and re-crossing the wrists below the waist.

- No ball - by extending one arm horizontally.

- Out - by raising an index finger above the head. (If not out, the umpire shall call Not out.)

- Wide - by extending both arms horizontally.

- When the ball is dead, the bowler’s end umpire shall repeat the signals in 2.13.1.1, with the exception of the signal for Out, to the scorers.

- The signals listed below shall be made to the scorers only when the ball is dead.

- Boundary 4 - by waving an arm from side to side finishing with the arm across the chest.

- Boundary 6 - by raising both arms above the head.

- Bye - by raising an open hand above the head.

- Commencement of last hour - by pointing to a raised wrist with the other hand.

- Five Penalty runs awarded to the batting side - by repeated tapping of one shoulder runs awarded to with the opposite hand.

- Five Penalty runs awarded to the fielding side - by placing one hand on the opposite runs awarded to shoulder.

- Leg bye - Not applicable for TCA.

- New ball - by holding the ball above the head.

- Revoke the last decision - by touching both shoulders, each with the opposite hand.

- Short-run - by bending one arm upwards and touching the nearer shoulder with the tips of the fingers.

- The following signals are for Levels 3 and 4 of the player conduct offenses.  Each signal has two parts, both of which should be acknowledged separately by the scorers.

### Level 3 conduct

- Part 1 - by putting one arm out to the side of the body and repeatedly raising it and lowering it.

- Part 2 - by raising both hands, all fingers spread, to shoulder height, palms facing towards the scorers.

### Level 4 conduct

- Part 1 - by putting one arm out to the side of the body and repeatedly raising it and lowering it.

- Part 2 - by raising an index finger, held at shoulder height, to the side of the body.

2.13.1.4  All the signals in 2.13.1.3 are to be made by the bowler’s end umpire except that for Short run, which is to be signalled by the umpire at the end where short running occurs.  However, the bowler’s end umpire shall be responsible both for the final signal of Short run to the scorers and, if more than one run is short, for informing them as to the number of runs to be recorded.

2.13.2 The umpire shall wait until each signal to the scorers has been separately acknowledged by a scorer before allowing play to proceed.

If several signals are to be used, they should be given in the order that the events occurred.

### Informing the umpires

Throughout the Laws, wherever the umpires are to receive information from captains or other players, it will be sufficient for one umpire to be so informed and for him/her to inform the other umpire.

### Correctness of scores

Consultation between umpires and scorers on doubtful points is essential.  The umpires shall, throughout the match, satisfy themselves as to the correctness of the number of runs scored, the wickets that have fallen and, where appropriate, the number of overs bowled.  They shall agree on these with the scorers at least at every interval, other than a drinks interval, and at the conclusion of the match.  See Laws 3.2 (Correctness of scores), 16.8 (Correctness of result) and 16.10 (Result not to be changed).

### Umpiring Assignment

Each team is required to complete umpiring assignments in both the Round Robin and Playoff phases of the tournament. Umpiring assignments are subject to change and GC reserves rights to do that. Teams will be required to send umpires for the games their team has been assigned to by the TCA-BA Games Committee and the schedule released by TCA-BA GC. THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS.

Umpires are required to arrive latest by game start time. If the Umpire(s) arrive after the game start time, then they can officiate the game only if both the Captains agree and/or if the 1st innings is not more than 15 minutes old. If the umpire is not allowed to officiate the match, it will be treated as Umpire no show.


There will be 2 umpires assigned from the same or different teams for a game during the Round Robin Phase of the event.
There will be 2 umpires assigned for a given game during the Playoffs phase of the event.
There will be 2 umpires assigned from the same or different teams for a ranking game.
In some cases, TCA shall assign one umpire for a game.

Important note: It can so happen that a team can get umpiring and game on the same weekend. This won’t happen in general but sometimes when more number of games need to schedule we may ask teams to play games on one day and umpiring another day. In playoffs and Ranking team will have the game and one umpiring assignment on the same weekend.

The number of umpiring: Each team will have umpiring count equal to or greater than the number of games teams is scheduled play-in tournament. Say team scheduled for 8 RR games then they will have 8 umpiring assignments in the RR phase. Similarly for playoff and Ranking. TCA GC reserves the right to assign umpiring to any teams if it’s required.

Team Swapping Umpiring Assignments

Umpiring assignment swapping is okay provided swapping doesn’t result in umpires going for umpiring within the same group and selection criteria are within the group. Say team from group A cannot umpire game within group A and the same applies to playoffs. TCA GC will reject such swapping if playing teams raised the issue or it came it GC’s knowledge. Swapping is mutual understanding between teams and GC has no role to track it so originally schedule umpiring team will be held responsible for late or no show of umpires.

Important note: Teams required to accept their designated umpiring on match sync as per the schedule and later once sync mail goes out they can communicate the change on sync mail. In the case of umpire no-show or late-show, the swapped team will be held responsible and not the team that was originally scheduled for umpiring.

TCA Games Committee can assign umpiring duties to teams if there any schedule changes related to weather, ground, or other unforeseen circumstances. These changes can be during the Round Robin stages or during the playoffs.
