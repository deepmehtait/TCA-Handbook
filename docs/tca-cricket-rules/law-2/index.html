They shall agree on these with the scorers at least at every interval, other than a drinks interval, and at the conclusion of the match.  See Laws 3.2 (Correctness of scores), 16.8 (Correctness of result) and 16.10 (Result not to be changed).</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="umpiring-assignment">Umpiring Assignment<a href="#umpiring-assignment" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Umpiring Assignment" title="Direct link to Umpiring Assignment">​</a></h3><p>Each team is required to complete umpiring assignments in both the Round Robin and Playoff phases of the tournament. Umpiring assignments are subject to change and GC reserves rights to do that. Teams will be required to send umpires for the games their team has been assigned to by the TCA-BA Games Committee and the schedule released by TCA-BA GC. THERE ARE NO EXCEPTIONS.</p><p>Umpires are required to arrive latest by game start time. If the Umpire(s) arrive after the game start time, then they can officiate the game only if both the Captains agree and/or if the 1st innings is not more than 15 minutes old. If the umpire is not allowed to officiate the match, it will be treated as Umpire no show.</p><p>There will be 2 umpires assigned from the same or different teams for a game during the Round Robin Phase of the event.
There will be 2 umpires assigned for a given game during the Playoffs phase of the event.
There will be 2 umpires assigned from the same or different teams for a ranking game.
In some cases, TCA shall assign one umpire for a game.</p><p>Important note: It can so happen that a team can get umpiring and game on the same weekend. This won’t happen in general but sometimes when more number of games need to schedule we may ask teams to play games on one day and umpiring another day. In playoffs and Ranking team will have the game and one umpiring assignment on the same weekend.</p><p>The number of umpiring: Each team will have umpiring count equal to or greater than the number of games teams is scheduled play-in tournament. Say team scheduled for 8 RR games then they will have 8 umpiring assignments in the RR phase. Similarly for playoff and Ranking. TCA GC reserves the right to assign umpiring to any teams if it’s required.</p><p>Team Swapping Umpiring Assignments</p><p>Umpiring assignment swapping is okay provided swapping doesn’t result in umpires going for umpiring within the same group and selection criteria are within the group. Say team from group A cannot umpire game within group A and the same applies to playoffs. TCA GC will reject such swapping if playing teams raised the issue or it came it GC’s knowledge. Swapping is mutual understanding between teams and GC has no role to track it so originally schedule umpiring team will be held responsible for late or no show of umpires.</p><p>Important note: Teams required to accept their designated umpiring on match sync as per the schedule and later once sync mail goes out they can communicate the change on sync mail. In the case of umpire no-show or late-show, the swapped team will be held responsible and not the team that was originally scheduled for umpiring.</p><p>TCA Games Committee can assign umpiring duties to teams if there any schedule changes related to weather, ground, or other unforeseen circumstances. These changes can be during the Round Robin stages or during the playoffs.</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--prev" href="/TCA-Handbook/docs/tca-cricket-rules/law-1"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Previous</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Law 1: The Players</div></a><a class="pagination-nav__link pagination-nav__link--next" href="/TCA-Handbook/docs/tca-cricket-rules/law-3"><div class="pagination-nav__sublabel">Next</div><div class="pagination-nav__label">Law 3: Scorers</div></a></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#appointment-and-attendance" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Appointment and attendance</a></li><li><a href="#change-of-umpire" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Change of umpire</a></li><li><a href="#consultation-with-captains" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Consultation with captains</a></li><li><a href="#the-wickets-creases-and-boundaries" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">The wickets, creases, and boundaries</a></li><li><a href="#conduct-of-the-match-implements-and-equipment" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Conduct of the match, implements, and equipment</a></li><li><a href="#fair-and-unfair-play" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Fair and unfair play</a></li><li><a href="#fitness-for-play" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Fitness for play</a></li><li><a href="#suspension-of-play-in-dangerous-or-unreasonable-circumstances" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Suspension of play in dangerous or unreasonable circumstances</a></li><li><a href="#umpires-changing-ends" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Umpires changing ends</a></li><li><a href="#disagreement-and-dispute" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Disagreement and dispute</a></li><li><a href="#umpires-decision" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Umpire’s decision</a></li><li><a href="#signals" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Signals</a></li><li><a href="#level-3-conduct" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Level 3 conduct</a></li><li><a href="#level-4-conduct" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Level 4 conduct</a></li><li><a href="#informing-the-umpires" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Informing the umpires</a></li><li><a href="#correctness-of-scores" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Correctness of scores</a></li><li><a href="#umpiring-assignment" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Umpiring Assignment</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/TCA-Handbook/docs/tca-tournaments">TCA Tournament Rules</a></li><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/TCA-Handbook/docs/tca-cricket-rules">TCA General Rules</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://tennisballcricket.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">TCA Website<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://discordapp.com/invite/docusaurus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Facebook<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">WhatsApp<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/TCA-Handbook/blog">Blog</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Copyright © 2023 - TCA</div></div></div></footer></div>
